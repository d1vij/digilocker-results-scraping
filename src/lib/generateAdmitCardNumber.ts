/**
 * Algorithm:
 * Admit card number is of format FMRRSSCC
 * Where the characters represent
 * => F: 2nd last letter of father's name. If name is `RAJESH KUMAR` then L is `A` from KUMAR
 * => M: last letter of mothers's name. If name is `RANI KUMARI` then L is `I` from KUMARI
 * => RR: last 2 digits of roll number. If roll number is 12345678 then RR is 78
 * => SS: first 2 digits of school number. If school number is 81293 then SS is 81
 * => CC: middle 2 digits of center number. If center number is 923147 then CC is 31
 *
 *  Then the Student's Admit Card number will be AI788131
